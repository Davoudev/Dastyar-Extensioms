## 📦 Notes

This project uses a minimal setup with React + Vite and includes HMR and ESLint.

Vite officially supports two React plugins:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react): uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): uses **SWC**
